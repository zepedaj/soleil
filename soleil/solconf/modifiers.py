    Resolves ``node.value`` and treats the resolved value as a file path whose data will be used to replace the ``node.value``node. If the path is relative, two possibilities exist:

    1. An ancestor node was loaded from a file (the ancestor file), in which case the relative path is interpreted to be relative to the ancestor file folder.
    2. No ancestor node was loaded from a file, in which case the relative path is interpreted to be relative to the current working directory.

    Paths can be explicitly made to be relative to the current working directory with function :func:`functions.cwd`.

    .. rubric:: Workflow

    The normal ``load`` workflow is as follows:

    1. A key node's ``load`` modifier is applied as part of a call to :meth:`SolConf.modify` during :class:`SolConf` initialization.
    2. The target file path is obtained by resolving the key node's value attribute using ``node.value()``.
    3. The data in the target file is loaded and used to built a sub-tree.
    4. The sub-tree is used to replace the original :attr:`node.value` node in the original `SolConf` node tree.
    5. All modifiers are applied to all nodes of the newly inserted sub-tree.
    6. All remaining ``node`` modifiers after ``load`` are applied to the original key node (with the newly substituted value node).
    7. Modification of the original sub-tree as part of the :meth:`SolConf.modify` call continues with the remaining nodes.

    .. rubric:: Syntax

    A modifier can be added to the modifiers list using one of these syntaxes

    * load
    * load()
    * load(ext='.yaml')
